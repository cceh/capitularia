=================

Different parts of the :file:`Makefile` are called by cron at various intervals.
cron runs as the :ref:`user capitularia <user>`.

    - :ref:`transformations`
    - :ref:`html-generation-overview`
    - :ref:`fulltext-search-overview`

XSLT Dependencies
-----------------

The section of the Makefile that deals with the dependencies between manuscripts, xslt
stylesheets, and html files is generated by the Python script
:program:`python/xslt_dep.py`.

.. autoprogram:: python.xslt_dep:build_parser()
    :prog: xslt_dep.py
