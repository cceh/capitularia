 HTML Generation
=================

All TEI manuscript files are converted to one (or more) HTML files.  The HTML
files are then included into Wordpress pages with the :ref:`File Includer
plugin<file-includer>`.

.. note::

   The XSLT stylesheets are written in XSLT 1 for historical reasons.  That is
   why we still use xsltproc.  We plan to rewrite them in XSLT 3 and use Saxon
   as soon as possible. (Nov. 2019)

   }

     component "Cron"                       as cron
     component "Makefile"                   as make
     component saxon [mss-header.xsl
     mss-transcription.xsl
     mss-footer.xsl]
   }

   cloud "AFS publ/cache" as afs2 {
     database  "Manuscript files\n(HTML)"   as html
   }

   tei      --> saxon
   saxon    --> html

   cron .> make
   make .> saxon


The Makefile is run by cron on the Capitularia VM at regular intervals.

The manuscript and HTML files reside in the AFS.  The AFS is mounted onto
the VM.

The Makefile knows all the dependencies between the files and runs the
appropriate tools to keep the HTML files up-to-date with the manuscript files.

The HTML files are stored in the cache directory.

When a user accesses a manuscript page, Wordpress finds a shortcode for the
:ref:`File Includer plugin<file-includer>` in it.  Control is passed to the File
Includer plugin which checks the date of the filum includendum.  If the file is
newer than the data stored in the database it refreshes the database.  Then it
inserts the file's content into the page, which is finally sent to the user.

.. note::

   The Footnotes Post-Processor is still written in PHP.  We plan to rewrite it
   in Python along with the XSL stylesheets and move it to the VM. (Nov. 2019)
