XSLT Transformations
--------------------

   :local:

The transformations used to produce HTML from TEI.

The XSLT stylesheets were first written in XSLT 1 for historical reasons.  We
are currently (Feb. 2020) rewriting them in XSLT 3.  XSLT 3 transformation is
done with Saxon.  XSLT 1 transformation is done with xsltproc.

See also the overview: :ref:`html-generation`.
