Database Structure
==================


Schema *capitularia:*
---------------------

The teiHeader contains in msDesc/msPart references to capitularies and loci but
no reference to chapters.  The teiHeader includes capitularies not yet
transcribed.  This relation is caught in table `mss_capitularies`.

The body contains finer grained references to chapters and loci in the @corresp
and @xml:id, but only for already transcribed material.  This relation is caught
in table `mss_chapters`.

Note that the relation between the `mss_chapters` and `msparts` tables was
inferred using the loci, because there are no milestones for msParts/msItems in
the body.

The `mss_chapters_text` table contains the chapter's text preprocessed for the
collation tool.
