.. revealjs:: Use of Wordpress

   Advantages

   * simple functionality out of the box (content, user, ...)
   * you may write plugins for your more exotic functionality

   Disadvantages

   * you are locked into obsolete technology (PHP, mysql)
   * writing a plugin for everything gets tedious
   * some things do not fit well (cron jobs)

      }

      tei1 --> xslt
      tei2 --> xslt
      tei3 --> xslt

      xslt --> post
      post --> db

      db --> html1
      db --> html2
      db --> html3

   Drawbacks:

   * Must code everything as plugin in PHP.
   * Web servers at uni-koeln.de are only configured for XSLT 1.0.

   Open Questions:

   * Oxygen plugin for Git?
   * quick preview for editors?
